# Purpose:      run the stanford raytracer on blanca

# load singularity (needed to run this image)   
module load singularity/3.6.4

# go to projects directory! where this image and the config.json should be
cd /projects/$USER/
# execute the image using the python script which reads the config file and calls the raytracer binary 
singularity exec raytracer_latest.sif python3 /usr/src/app/python_setup/ray_input.py generatedRays.json
